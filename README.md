# AmazonEmployeeAccess
This repository contains the training and test data sets from the Kaggle "Amazon.com - Employee Access Challenge" Competition. Code for different predictive models can also be found. The purpose of participating retrospectively in this competition was to learn predicictive models for classification for a bianary response. In this specific competition, we predicted whether certain employees were granted access to certain resources or not.

A few notable models used were Penalized Logistic Regression, Kth Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Random Forests, and BART. Principle Component Dimension Reduction was also explored. Models were scored using area under the ROC curve and a Random Forest model with cross validation resulted in the best auc score according to the competition test set.
